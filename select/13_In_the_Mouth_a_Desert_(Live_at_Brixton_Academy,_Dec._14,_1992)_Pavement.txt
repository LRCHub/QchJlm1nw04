Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?

Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, favors down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

It's what I want (it's what I want)
It's what I want (twine comes down)
It's what I want (it's what I want)
Don't you know
I could make a try
Make a try
Make a try
Make a try

I've been crowned the King of Id
And Id is all we have, so wait
To hear my words
And they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up
And it's up and down

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh It's what (it's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (ball and twine)
Don't you know that
It's what I want? (it's what I want)
I'll see you beg and it makes you dry
Make me dry
Make me dry
Make me dry

I've been down, the King of Id's
Id's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait
To hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
