Wasn't the question you were asking
Wasn't my answer I gave
That made me feel like I was on train
Was a distant voice
Made me make the choice
That i had to get the fuck out of this town

I got a lot of things to do
A lot of places to go
I got a lot of good things coming my way
And im afraid to say that you're not one of them

Last time I was there
You were out on the couch
Pressed into a little electric tube
It was the way that you smiled
That made me know at once
That i had to get the fuck out of this town

Cause I've decided to make a stand
And I'm not taking your hand
I'm taking the next bus outta here
I'm gonna head to box elder
